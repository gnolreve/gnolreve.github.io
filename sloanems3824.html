    <h3>Sloane MS 3824 (from the mid-seventeenth century) features a number of elements from the Book of the Office of Spirits and is an early form of the Lemegeton. 
    </h3>
    <h3>MS 3853 is titled The Office of Spirits, and starts off nearly identical to the more complete Porter version. Sloane 3853 merely lists ten demons who also appear in hockleys manuscript and then names the demon kings of north, south, east, and west. Paymon being the king of the west respectively. Generic spirits under them and non descript spirits to obtain love or treasure. Sloane 3824 lists different unsorted magical procedures dropping names of spirits in passing rarely with explanation.</h3>
