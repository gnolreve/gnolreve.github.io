    <h3>Sloane MS 3824 is a 17th-century manuscript housed in the British Library, containing various occult texts, including material on demonology. In this manuscript, Paimon is identified as a King of the West, maintaining his royal status, much like in other grimoires such as the Ars Goetia and the Liber Officiorum Spirituum. However, Sloane MS 3824 provides additional details that are less commonly found elsewhere, particularly mentioning Paimonâ€™s bishop companion, Sperion, which is a unique inclusion among demonological texts. Like other sources, Paimon is described as riding a crowned dromedary camel, accompanied by a musical procession, reinforcing his traditional depiction as a regal and commanding figure. His abilities, in line with other grimoires, include granting wisdom, knowledge, and secrets, making him a significant figure in occult traditions. The manuscript emphasizes his obedience to Lucifer, suggesting a strict hierarchical structure within the infernal realm. Sloane MS 3824 aligns with many aspects of Paimon's portrayal in earlier demonological texts but stands out due to its unique details, which deepen the lore surrounding this enigmatic spirit.
