    <h3> The Livre dez Esprits is a 15th to 16th century French goetic grimoire that inspired later works such as Weyers Pseudomonarchia Daemonum and The Lesser key of Solomon. It's merely a list of the hierarchy of hell but includes each spirit's appearance and function as well as how many legions of demons serve under them. </h3>
    <h3>Poymon is described as a man riding a dromedary preceded by the playing of loud music particularly trumpets as well as cymbals. Unlike some sources that say he held command over 200 legions of spirits, The Livre Des Esprits only credits him with 25 legions of spirits. And The Livre Des Esprits and the Grimorire Of Pope Honorius. In both the Livre Des Espritz as Poymon and in The Grimoire Of Pope Honorius as Bayemon he is always described as the king of the west.</h3></h3>
