    <h3> The Livre des Esperitz is one of the earliest French demonology texts, dating back to the 16th century. It presents a list of 46 demons, including Paimon, who is identified as one of the four kings ruling over the cardinal directions. In this text, Paimon (spelled "Poymon") is associated with the west, and it is stated that anyone summoning him should face that direction.
Paimon is also mentioned in other grimoires, such as the Lesser Key of Solomon and Dictionnaire Infernal, where he is described as a powerful king of Hell, often depicted riding a dromedary camel and accompanied by loud music. He is said to command legions of spirits, though the number varies across sourcesâ€”some claim 200 legions, while the Livre des Esperitz credits him with only 25 legions.
His role in demonology is often linked to wisdom, knowledge, and hidden secrets, making him a sought-after figure in occult traditions. Some interpretations suggest that Paimon may have origins tied to Middle Eastern deities, though this is debated. </h3>
