<h3>In the book of abramelin where Paimon is given no name or description he is instead one of the eight dukes.
</h3>
<h3> The book of abramelin tells a story of an egyptian mage who taught a system of magic to abraham of worms, a jewish man in worms, Germany. The character of Abraham of worms narrates his travel to the Egyptian desert where an elderly mage offers him two manuscripts containing knowledge of kabbalistic magic which is an esoteric method and a discipline school of thought in jewish mysticism. Abraham extracts an oath that binds him in service of God and the divine law. Divine law being described as any body of law that is perceived as deriving from a transcendent source, such as the will of god or gods.
</h3>
<h3> The extensive hierarchies of demons in the book are meant to represent the various forces and aspects of nature and human nature that can be manipulated by the magician. The demons are divided into four groups each corresponding to one of the four cardinal directions and one of the four elements: fire, water, air, and earth under four chief spirits. 
</h3>
<h3>Paimon is also frequently written “Paymon", and sometimes “Paimonia". Probably from Hebrew, POMN, = a tinkling sound or small bell. This is again derived from the Hebrew root POM, = to agitate, impel, or strike forward. The word POMN is employed in Exodus 28, 34; 28, 33; and 39, 25. Paimon is also called by the Rabbins by the title of OZAZL, Azazel, which is a name used in Leviticus with reference to the Scape-Goat. Its derivation is from OZ, = a Goat; and AZL, = to go away. It has frequently been warmly discussed whether the word in question means simply the Scape-Goat, or whether it signifies a Demon to whom that animal was dedicated. But in Rabbinic Demonology it is always used to mean one of the Chief Demons.
