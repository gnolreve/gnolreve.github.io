<h3>In the book of abramelin where Paimon is given no name or description he is instead one of the eight dukes.
</h3>
<h3> The book of abramelin tells a story of an egyptian mage who taught a system of magic to abraham of worms, a jewish man in worms, Germany. The character of Abraham of worms narrates his travel to the Egyptian desert where an elderly mage offers him two manuscripts containing knowledge of kabbalistic magic which is an esoteric method and a discipline school of thought in jewish mysticism. Abraham extracts an oath that binds him in service of God and the divine law. Divine law being described as any body of law that is perceived as deriving from a transcendent source, such as the will of god or gods.
</h3>
<h3> The extensive hierarchies of demons in the book are meant to represent the various forces and aspects of nature and human nature that can be manipulated by the magician. The demons are divided into four groups each corresponding to one of the four cardinal directions and one of the four elements: fire, water, air, and earth under four chief spirits.
