    <h3>The Liber Officiorum Spirituum is a lesser-known grimoire that details various spirits and their ranks. It includes Paimon, who is described as a king and is noted for his obedience to Lucifer. In this text, Paimon is first listed as the sixth spirit and later as the third king. His depiction is consistent with other grimoiresâ€”he is said to ride a dromedary camel, accompanied by loud music, particularly trumpets and cymbals.
Like in the Ars Goetia and Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, Paimon is associated with wisdom, knowledge, and hidden secrets, making him a sought-after figure in occult traditions. The Liber Officiorum Spirituum also emphasizes his hierarchical position, stating that he is more obedient to Lucifer than other kings
