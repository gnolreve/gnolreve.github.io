    <h3> Liber Officiorum Spirituum the name in english translating The Book of the Office of Spirits was a demonological grimoire and a major source for Johann Weyer's Pseudomonarchia Daemonum and the Ars Goetia. The original work (if it is a single work) has not been located, but some derived texts bearing the title have been found, some in the Sloane manuscripts, some in the Folger Shakespeare Library. Each version bears many similarities to each other and to the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum and the Ars Goetia, though they are far from identical. The manuscript in the Folger Shakespeare library is preceded by sundry materials lifted from Arbatel de magia veterum (amazingly only two years after its publication), the Enchiridion of Pope Leo III, and Sefer Raziel HaMalakh, and followed with a version of the Key of Solomon.</h3>
    <h3> The section Officium de spirittibus begins describing "the three devils" (Lucifer, Bael, and Satan), and the four kings of the air (Leraje over the east, Paimon the west, Aim the north, and Bune the south), and the means of calling them. It then lists an additional seventy-five demons, for a total of eighty-two. Many of the demons are comparable to those in the Lesser Key of Solomon.</h3>
    <h3>The next to last entry, "Oberyon," shifts the focus from demons to fairies. After the eighty-one demons, the book details Mycob wife of Oberyon and their seven daughters. It then repeats the four kings of the air, listing twelve demons under each of them. After this, it begins describing the spirits of the days of the week and the incenses and conjurations needed to summon them, lifting material from The Sworn Book of Honorius and Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy. It follows with a list of Greek and Roman gods, a note about which spirits rule Hell, and an entry to summon spirits "that make books and write books," before giving instructions on how to summon the angel over each day of the week, including instructions for magic circles, consecrations, use of holy water and exorcisms of fire. This portion uses elements of scripture, Sarum Missal, the Key of Solomon, Arbatel, Honorius, Agrippa, Raziel, and what would become the Tridentine Mass. It also shares some prayers found in the Munich Manual of Demonic Magic.</h3>
