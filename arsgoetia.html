<h1> ꒰ঌ Ars Goetia ໒꒱</h1>
<h2> King Paimon</h2>
<h3><img src="unnamed (2).gif" alt="" style="width:500px;height:250px;"> </h3>
<h3>The Ars Goetia, also known as the 72 Pillars or the Lemegeton is a group of seventy two demons with exemplary strength and their own legions. They are listed in the grimoire Lesser Key of Solomon. Paimon is the 9th spirit of Ars Goetia and the King of Hell that is the most obedient to Lucifer. </h3>
<h3>Paimon was an angel that resided in Heaven, either belonging to the Order of Dominions while others say the Order of Cherubim. He was among the angels that was the most captivated by Lucifer's music, giving awareness to the Morning Star via attempting to match the notes of his instruments with Lucifer's singing. Lucifer, while impressed, did not pay that much attention to Paiman due to his pride but Paimon remained loyal. He was among the angels that was the most captivated by Lucifer's music, giving awareness to the Morning Star via attempting to match the notes of his instruments with Lucifer's singing. As a result of being captivated by Lucifer's power, beauty, and mind he was unsurprisingly on Lucifer's side during the War in Heaven, only to be defeated by the angel Haziel. He was cast down to Hell alongside all other rebel-angles. He was present at Pandemonium during Lucifer's Rally, officially declaring himself as the most loyal servant of Lucifer. Because of his loyalty and overall usefulness to Lucifer, Paimon was elected a king of Hell and joined the musical choir of Hell that sings Lucifer's glory.
</h3>
<h3>Being a mighty king of Hell, Paimon was given two hundred legions of demons under his rule. He is said to rule 25-100-200 legions of spirits, some of which are of the order of angels and the rest Powers. Much like most other powerful demons, he has his own band of demented Satanic worshipers who go to great and unholy lengths to have him manifest in the material realm. His worshipers want him to manifest in the mortal world, so he can make them wealthy and knowledgeable.Paimon is also said to behave much like a traditional genie where he would grant the conjurer a wish but the conjurer in question must be specific in their wish for Paimon could easily twist the order. 
</h3>
<h3>When the conjurer invokes this demon he must look towards the northwest, for there is where he has his house, and when Paimon appears he must be allowed to ask what he wishes and be answered, in order to obtain the same from him.Paimon is an extremely unrelenting opponent, in both his manipulation and hostility towards humans. He maliciously inflicts severe psychological, physical and spiritual torment upon his victims, including reconstruction of traumatic events, as well as horrifying visions and nightmares. Paimon is full of energy. Loud noises and bright lights tend to make him more active. He can also be surprisingly very colorful and very friendly.
</h3>
<h3>Out of all the Goetia demons, Paimon has some of the strongest loyalties to Lucifer. He has an unnaturally loud voice and when continuing speaking at such ear-splitting volume the summoner has to command Paimon to alter his speech in order to understand him. 
</h3>
<h3>Paimon teaches all arts, philosophy and sciences, and secret things; he can reveal all mysteries of the Earth, wind and water, what the mind is, and everything the conjurer wants to know, gives good familiars, dignities and confirms them, binds men to the conjurer's will.
</h3>
<h3>If Paimon is cited alone, some offering or sacrifice must be done, and he will accept it; then two kings called Beball and Abalam will go to him together with other spirits, often twenty-five legions; but these other spirits do not always come unless the conjurer calls upon them. Great caution must be taken in the conjuration of Paimon as he is able to bring undesirable and dangerous spirits as well as the chaste and honorable.
</h3>
<h3>He can reveal answers to such mysteries as the nature of the Earth, the location of the Abyss, and the origin of the wind. He can bestow dignitaries and provide familiars against enemies while binding anyone resisting him in his own chains.</h3>
