    <h3>In this text, Paimon is listed among 69 demons, rather than the 72 found in the Ars Goetia. He is described as a powerful king, commanding 200 legions of spirits. Like other sources, Paimon is depicted as riding a dromedary camel and accompanied by a loud procession of musicians. He is said to grant knowledge, wisdom, and secrets, making him a sought-after figure in occult traditions.
Unlike later grimoires, Pseudomonarchia Daemonum does not provide sigils for the demons, and its descriptions are slightly different from those in the Ars Goetia. Weyer himself was skeptical of demonology, and his work was intended to discredit the belief in witchcraft rather than promote it.
