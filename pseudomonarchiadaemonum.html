    <h3> The Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, or False Monarchy of Demons, first appears as an Appendix to De Praestigiis Daemonumin, De Praestigiis Daemonum, translated as On the Tricks of Demons, is a book by medical doctor Johann Weyer, also known as Wier, first published in Basel in 1563.The book argues that witchcraft does not exist and that those who claim to practice it are suffering from delusions, which should be treated as mental illnesses, rather than punished as witchcraft. It was influential in the abolishment of witchcraft trials in the Netherlands. </h3>
    <h3>The Pseudomonarchia Daemonum is a grimoire similar to the Ars Goetia but pre-dates it and served as heavy inspiration for the later text. It contains a list of demons and appropriate hours and rituals to conjure them. It lists 69 demons in contrast to the later 72.</h3>
    <h3>King Paimon is the 22th spirit in The Pseudomonarchia Daemonum but their sequence varies along with some of their characteristics and Weyers notes confess confusion over whether Paimon was a former dominion or cherubim. Weyer referred to his source manuscript as Liber officiorum spirituum, Seu Liber Dictus Empto. Salomonis, de principibus et regibus daemoniorum (Book of the offices of spirits, or the book called 'Empto'. Solomon, concerning the princes and kings of demons.) This work is likely related to a very similar 1583 manuscript titled The Office of Spirits, both of which appear ultimately be an elaboration on a fifteenth-century manuscript titled Le Livre des Esperitz of which 30 of its 47 spirits are nearly identical to spirits in the Ars Goetia.</h3>
