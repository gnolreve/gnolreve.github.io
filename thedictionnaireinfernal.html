<h3>Paimon is depicted as a King of Hell, consistent with other grimoires like the Ars Goetia. In the 1863 edition, he is illustrated as a regal figure, riding a dromedary camel and accompanied by a musical procession. His abilities include granting knowledge, wisdom, and secrets, making him a sought-after figure in occult traditions. The book describes him as more obedient to Lucifer than other kings, reinforcing his hierarchical status.
Unlike earlier grimoires, the Dictionnaire Infernal was influenced by Catholic theology, as de Plancy later converted to Roman Catholicism and revised his views on demonology. This shift is evident in later editions, where demons are portrayed as real entities rather than mere superstitions.
