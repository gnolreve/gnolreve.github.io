    <h3>From Hoyoverses Genshin Impact Paimon is introduced to us as our quirky travel companion and guide as well as the deuteragonist of Genshin Impact. Shes named after the demon and is a direct refrence to the mythological spirit. </h3>
    <h3> Paimon being a reference to our beloved demon is fitting as Hoyoverse is known to pull inspiration from other mythologies and works of fiction for character design and character story. The Archons of Teyvat are great examples pf this cause they to have corresponding demon names and are refered to as demon gods in some cases. The hierarchy of the Archons and heavenly principles seem to take insperation from earlier hierarchies such as the Ars Goetia, The Livre Des Espiritz, and the Liber Officiorum Spirituum to name a few. An example being Ei, the current archon ruling over Inazuma whos corresponding demon name is Beelzebub along with the other archons having corresponding demon names. The archon war was a battle of the demon gods for power over there part of Teyvat and the title of Archon from the heavenly princibles and paimon is notably not mentioned. Paimons said to be the most obiedant to lucifer, so figureing out lucifers genshin conterpart will be important.

    <h3>Paimon has been theorized to have hailed from Celestia and theorized to be a Seele with even more evidence from the 4.4 new world quest. It's also theorized that she's a moon sister but who knows. It would make sense that Paimon is part of the supposed celestial hierarchy as either a fallen Seele or moon sister although the timeline roughly lines up with when she fell into the lake and was met by the traveler. 
    </h3>
    <h3>Her design is of a little flouting “fairy” with a crown and the symbol of the triquetra, also known as a "trinity knot" upside down on her stomach. The knot is often a symbol of the three stages of life or life itself and the reversed symbol could be a reference to the movement towards death. The symbol also inspires the imaginary element from some of there other games. Some of Paimons notable inspirations come from the Ars Goetia of the Lesser Key Of Solomon where it is stated that Paimon can reveal mysteries of the earth including where the location of the abyss is so that could be interesting to see explored in game in the future.°❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･
