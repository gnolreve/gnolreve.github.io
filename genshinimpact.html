    <h2> Paimon, 派蒙 Pàiméng</h2>

    <h3>From Hoyoverses Genshin Impact Paimon is introduced to us as our quirky travel companion and guide as well as the deuteragonist of Genshin Impact. Shes named after the demon and is a direct refrence to the mythological spirit. </h3>
    <h3> Paimon being a reference to our beloved demon is fitting as Hoyoverse is known to pull inspiration from other mythologies and works of fiction for character design and character story. The Archons of teyvat are great examples of this as not only do they have corresponding demon names and are refered to as demon gods but the hierarchy of the archons and the heavenly principles seem to be based on demonic hierarchies from works such as the Ars Goetia of the Lesser Key Of Solomon, The Livre Des Espiritz, the Liber Officiorum Spirituum, ex. An example being Ei, the current archon ruling over Inazuma whos corresponding demon name is Beelzebub. Figures such as archons having corresponding demon names make sense because they are directly part of the heavenly principles hierarchy. 
    </h3>
    <h3>Paimon has been theorized to have hailed from Celestia and theorized to be a Seele with even more evidence from the 4.4 new world quest. It's also theorized that she's a moon sister but who knows. It would make sense that Paimon is part of the supposed celestial hierarchy as either a fallen Seele or moon sister although the timeline roughly lines up with when she fell into the lake and was met by the traveler. 
    </h3>
    <h3>Her design is of a little flouting “fairy” with a crown and the symbol of the triquetra, also known as a "trinity knot" upside down on her stomach. The knot is often a symbol of the three stages of life or life itself and the reversed symbol could be a reference to the movement towards death. The symbol also inspires the imaginary element from some of there other games. Some of Paimons notable inspirations come from the Ars Goetia of the Lesser Key Of Solomon where it is stated that Paimon can reveal mysteries of the earth including where the location of the abyss is so that could be interesting to see explored in game in the future.°❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･
